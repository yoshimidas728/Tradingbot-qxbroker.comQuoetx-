Documentation for the BOT at qxbroker.com
This documentation provides an overview of the key Python and JavaScript scripts used for the BOT at qxbroker.com:
1.	qxbroker.com.py: Manages all system processes related to the BOT, handling core functionalities and system interactions.
2.	wsHook.js: Manages all websocket processes related to the BOT, ensuring proper functionality and system interactions.
3.	bypass.js: Handles bypass mechanisms related to the BOT's operations.
4.	strategies.py: Functions as the decision interceptor, determining actions based on the input provided by the system.
Modifications and Focus:
•	qxbroker.com.py: No changes are necessary unless specifically required. It is responsible for managing system processes, so modifications should be approached with caution.
•	wsHook.js: Similarly, this file should remain unchanged unless there is a specific need. It handles websocket-related functionalities and system interactions.
•	bypass.js: No changes are needed unless absolutely necessary. It deals with bypass mechanisms and should be modified carefully.
•	strategies.py: This is the primary focus. It serves as the decision-making component of the BOT.
Operation:
•	Transaction Handling: When a transaction is initiated, qxbroker.com.py calls the strategies.py decision interceptor with the function strategy(user_input, instruments_list, trade_data).
•	File Structure and Comments: The strategies.py file is thoroughly commented, offering detailed explanations of each component of the input system. It includes a basic strategy using random actions to demonstrate fundamental decision-making logic.
Return Values:
•	The decision interceptor (strategies.py) must return one of the following values:
o	"call"
o	"put"
This ensures that the BOT receives clear and actionable instructions for each transaction.
Feel free to explore and modify strategies.py to enhance the decision-making process, while remembering that qxbroker.com.py handles the overall system operations.

Example: Basic Strategy
import random

def strategy(user_input, instruments_list, trade_data):

    #user_input['trade_option'] = "put"#If your logic is specified as "put"
    #user_input['trade_option'] = "call"#If your logic is specified as "call"
    user_input['trade_option'] = "random"#If your logic is specified as "random"

    if user_input['trade_option'] == 'random':
        return random.choice(['call', 'put'])
    # Else return a specified one
    return user_input['trade_option']
